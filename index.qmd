Hi, I’m Kevin! I’m a fifth-year Ph.D. candidate in Statistics at Colorado State University, where I work with Dr. Matthew Koslovsky. My research focuses on applying Bayesian methods to analyze complex biological data. I develop techniques for handling zero-inflated and high-dimensional datasets, with an emphasis on scalability. Beyond Bayesian statistics, I am also interested in computational statistics. In terms of applications, I work with human microbiome data and disease detection. I am also passionate about creating R packages to make statistical tools more accessible to researchers.

Previously, I earned my master’s degree in Applied Statistics from the University of Michigan–Ann Arbor and my bachelor’s degree in Mathematical Statistics from Chulalongkorn University in Thailand.
